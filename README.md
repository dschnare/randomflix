# RandomFlix

RandomFlix is a browser extension that adds the capability to choose a random movie on Netflix.

This extension adds a new `Random` button in the main navigation bar that will choose a random movie from the current page and scroll to the chosen movie and highlighting it. If on the
Kids section then the movie will play immediately without highlighting it (this is a shortcomming of the Netflix front-end scripting).
